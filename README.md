# Checkers-Simulation

This project is made for the "Jugend Forscht" competition.

Goal is to program a versatile platform to test and compare different algorithms against one another by letting them play checkers.

In the finished program you will be able to add your one checkers playing algorithm as a module written in java.

## How to use
### Installing
This should be really easy. Just download the master branch and start the jar file. You will however need the newest [Java version](https://www.java.com/de/)
### Starting a game
Simply click on Game>new Game. In the upcoming window you can choose what players should participate in this new game, if the game should be recorded (for later analysis or reloading of certain situations. See Load and save games), the speed of the ai  (so you can see what it is doing) and an optional game name (only required for saving the game). In the two drop down menus you will see every valid player placed in the [resources/AI](resources/AI) directory and a 'player' option. This stands for the human player. When you are done just click confirm.
